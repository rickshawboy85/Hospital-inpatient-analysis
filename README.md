# Hospital-inpatient-analysis
Linear regression project in which I attempt to predict the length-of-stay of inpatients using only the data available upon their arrival at hospital.

# Contents of the repository:
main.py: imports necessary libraries and executes all functions for cleaning data, visualising feature relationships, training models and analysing results. To execute it, set the path to the location of the folder containing all the files. 

Data: .csv file with all the data used for the project. Dimensions: 2346760 rows, 37 columns. 

Scripts: Scripts containing the functions executed in main.py

Plots: plots of relationships between features and target

df1, df2, df3, df4, df5: contain sections of the data set and should be concatenated before executing the main.py script.

Memoria: a Powerpoint-style presentation of the project and my final memoir of the project
