# Hospital-inpatient-analysis
Machine learning project in which I utitlize linear regression algorithms in an attempt to predict the length-of-stay of inpatients using only the data available upon their arrival at hospital.

# Contents of the repository:
main.py: imports necessary libraries and executes all functions for cleaning data, visualising feature relationships, training models and analysing results. In order to execute the varios functions, set the path to the project folder containing the all the downloaded files and place the tables (df1, df2, df3, df4, df5) into subfolder named "Data" inside the project folder. Create another subfolder called "Outputs" to place the cleaned and transformed datasets.

Scripts: Scripts containing the functions executed in main.py

Plots: plots of relationships between features and target and final results

df1, df2, df3, df4, df5: contain sections of the data set and will be concatenated automatically upon calling the LoadData function in the main.py script. Dimensions: 2346760 rows, 37 columns.
