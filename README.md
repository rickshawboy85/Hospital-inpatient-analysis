# Hospital-inpatient-analysis
Machine learning project in which I utitlize liniear regression algorithms in an attempt to predict the length-of-stay of inpatients using only the data available upon their arrival at hospital.

# Contents of the repository:
main.py: imports necessary libraries and executes all functions for cleaning data, visualising feature relationships, training models and analysing results. Set the path to the folder containing the all the downloaded files in order to execute the varios functions.

Scripts: Scripts containing the functions executed in main.py

Plots: plots of relationships between features and target

df1, df2, df3, df4, df5: contain sections of the data set and will be concatenated automatically upon calling the read_data function in the main.py script. Dimensions: 2346760 rows, 37 columns.

Memoria: a Powerpoint-style presentation of the project and my final memoir of the project
